# NFT-TourismProject

This project is created to generate a smart contract that generates NFTs for a set of cruise cabins. It is a test and is only performed as a base proof of concept so it should not be used in productive environments.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
